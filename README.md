Data Visualization:
To gain insights into the dataset, I employed several visualization techniques, including scatter plots, line plots, and box plots. These visualizations helped me understand the relationships between the advertising variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the sales outcome.

Data Preprocessing:
Before proceeding with the analysis, I performed data preprocessing steps. This included dropping unnecessary columns from the dataset to focus on the relevant features. The dataset consisted of advertising data points for TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales.

Model Building and Evaluation:
I split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate different regression models. I utilized the following algorithms:

Random Forest Regression:

Mean Squared Error: 0.6578774652777781
R2 Score: 0.9771788235095732
Decision Tree Regression:

Mean Squared Error: 1.525
R2 Score: 0.9470991241002515
Linear Regression:

Mean Squared Error: 2.136599802727084
R2 Score: 0.9258832780252507
Conclusions:
Based on the evaluation results, the decision tree regression model achieved the highest R2 score of 0.947, indicating a good fit to the data. The random forest regression model also performed well with an R2 score of 0.977. Both models exhibited lower mean squared errors, indicating their effectiveness in predicting sales.

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to analyze advertising data and predict sales. By leveraging visualizations and regression models, valuable insights can be derived to optimize advertising strategies and enhance sales performance.
